        Search property content for active properties in the requested language.<br><br>

        When searching with query parameter, `property_id`, you may request 1 to 250 properties at a time.<br><br>

        When searching with query parameters other than `property_id`, the response will be paginated. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed. If the link expires, there will be an `expires` link-extension that is the UTC date the link will expire, in ISO 8601 format.<br>

          * Example: `<https://api.ean.com/2.3/properties/content?token=MY5S3j36cOcLfLBZjPYQ1abhfc8CqmjmFVzkk7euvWaunE57LLeDgaxm516m>; rel="next"; expires="2019-03-05T07:23:14.000Z"`<br><br>

        The response is a JSON map where the key is the property ID and the value is the property object itself, which can include property-level, room-level and rate-level information.

        Returns the geographic definition and property mappings of regions matching the specified parameters.<br><br>

        To request all regions in the world, omit the `ancestor` query parameter. To request all regions in a specific continent, country or other level, specify the ID of that region as the `ancestor`. Refer to the list of [top level regions](https://developer.expediapartnersolutions.com/reference/geography-reference-lists-2-2/).<br><br>

        The response is a paginated list of regions. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed. If the link expires, there will be an `expires` link-extension that is the UTC date the link will expire, in ISO 8601 format.<br>

        Confirms the price returned by the Property Availability response. Use this API to verify a previously-selected rate is still valid before booking. If the price is matched, the response returns a link to request a booking. If the price has changed, the response returns new price details and a booking link for the new price. If the rate is no longer available, the response will return a new Property Availability request link to search again for different rates. In the event of a price change, go back to Property Availability and book the property at the new price or return to additional rates for the property.

      description: |
        Returns a complete collection of chains recognized by the Rapid API.

        <br>Chains represent a parent company which can have multiple brands associated with it. A brand can only be associated with one chain. For example, Hilton Worldwide is a chain that has multiple associated brands including Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.

        <br>The response is a JSON map where the key is the chain ID and the value is a chain object. Each chain object also contains a map of its related brands.

        <br>Note that the set of chain IDs and brand IDs are totally independent of one another. It is possible for a chain and a brand to both use the same number as their ID, but this is just a coincidence that holds no meaning.

        <br>Chain and brand names are provided in English only.
